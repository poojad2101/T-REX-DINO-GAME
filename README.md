# T-REX DINO GAME #


Do you remember that pretty dull looking black and white dino game when you are offline on chrome??
well, i have re-created it with a completely different look. Yes! The dino has got a makeover!!
This game is ridiculously simple to play and probably the best way to kill your time when you have plenty of it in your hands. The concept is same old and clear. Press any key to make the dino jump to save it from hitting the rock!!
